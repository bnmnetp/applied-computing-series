Equation of a Line (Refresher)
==============================

  :alt: Slope intercept form: y equals m times x plus b.

All line equations in this text will be presented in the form *y = mx + b*,
where *m* is the slope and *b* is the y-intercept. This is also called
slope-intercept form. The **y-intercept** is the y-value at the point where the
line crosses the y-axis. The :ref:`slope <interpreting-slope>` gives the steepness
of the line, and can be positive, negative, or zero. Slope-intercept form is a
method to better understand the relationship between the two variables *x* and *y*.

  :width: 49%
  :alt: A graph of the equation of y equals 2 times x plus one. 

The equation of the line in the above figure has a y-intercept of 1 and a positive slope.
