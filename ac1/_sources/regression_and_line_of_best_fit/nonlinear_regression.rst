Non-Linear Regression
=====================

Up to this point you’ve only fit straight lines to data, but Sheets can fit
other trendlines to data as well, including exponential, polynomial, logarithmic
and more. You can access these other options from the chart editor. 

To change the type of a trendline in sheets you can go to "Chart Editor" 
> “Customize Menu” > “Series,” and after checking the trendline option, you can select
“Type.” Then you will see a  dropdown menu with different types of trendlines.

For example, the number of users of a certain popular website grew dramatically
between 2004 and 2010. In this case, the linear trendline, on the left, does 
not fit the exponential growth seen in number of users. The exponential curve,
on the right, fits this example much better.

You should be careful when choosing trendline type. For example, a polynomial
curve can be fit to the latitude and January temperature data.

But, in this case, switching to a polynomial curve doesn’t help explain the
relationship between latitude and January temperature since the temperature 
should get *colder* as the latitude of the city increases, not warmer as the 
curve indicates. This curve, like the line of best fit, is sensitive to the 
outlier of Juneau, which is much further north than the other cities. It is 
better to first try linear regression and check if it fits the data, before 
moving on to non-linear regression.  

**Overfitting** is when your predictive line or curve fits too closely to a
particular set of data, and may not make reliable predictions for other sets of 
data. For example, consider a set of temperature and latitude data with only 
five cities. When looking at only these five data points, the trend seems 
curved, and this fourth degree polynomial curve fits nicely!

But as more cities are added in, it becomes apparent that this trendline doesn’t
fit new cities at all. The polynomial curve was overfit to the data, and a
linear regression line would have predicted the other cities better. This can 
be seen below when comparing the top and bottom graph.

The complete set of July temperatures, in red, has a strong, linear trend. The
dataset with only five cities appeared to have a curve because the number of
cities was so small. When you only have a few data points in your sample, you
can always find a polynomial curve that passes through that small number of
points. But these curves often don't describe the larger collection of numbers
any better than a straight line. Unless you have a good reason to think the data
should be curved (for example, if you have some domain knowledge which predicts
a polynomial relationship), a straight line is the best choice.
